              I would consider my car hobby always a project, constantly installing car parts and fixing things on this unreliable car. 
              I am also a car Enthusiast. This is one of my cars. 
              It is an 2005 Subaru Impreza, I got it back in 2020 when I first started working. My first car unfortunately is a Jetta.
            I have some mods on it such as headers from an 04
          Impreza and an after market muffler. I spend a lot of time also on Photoshop, Krita, and Power Director for stopmotions.

                I also am a starwars guy and lego guy, I collect mainly lego starwars items and have put in a lot of time with that subject. 
                I even had my own small buisness at one point, I used to own a WAINLUX JL7 which is a Laser Engraver and I would engrave on metals such as bronze and gold
                molded into lego figures so essentially was creating a custom torso image. (This picture was from an Instagram post I made.)
